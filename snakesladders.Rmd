```{r}
move <- 0
count <- replicate(1000, 0)
game_grid <- data.frame(c(3,6,9,10,14,19,22,24),c(11,17,18,12,4,8,20,16))
for (i in 1:1000) {
  spot <- 1
  while (spot <= 25) {
  move <- sample(1:6, 1)
  spot <- spot + move
  for (i in 1:8) {
    if (spot == game_grid[i,1]) {
      spot <- game_grid[i,2]
    }
  }
  count[i] = count[i] + 1
  }
}
avg_moves <- mean(count)
print(avg_moves)
